# Project for EDA Practice

The following objectives are set with the intention to practice Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques:

## Objectives

1. **Improve customer experience by analyzing sales data.**
   - Perform EDA to understand customer behaviors and sales trends.
   - Visualize different aspects of sales data to uncover insights.
   - Preprocess and clean data to ensure accurate analysis.
   
   **Python Libraries for EDA:**
   - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
   - `numpy`: For numerical computing.
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For creating informative and attractive visualizations.
   - `scipy`: For scientific computing and technical computing.

2. **Increase revenue.**
   - Use EDA to identify potential areas for revenue growth.
   - Analyze customer segments to tailor marketing strategies.
   - Evaluate product performance to inform product development.

Remember, the key to effective EDA is to ask questions, make hypotheses, and use visualizations to find patterns and insights in the data. Happy analyzing!
