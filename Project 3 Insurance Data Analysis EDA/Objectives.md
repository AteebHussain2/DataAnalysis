## Objectives

This project aims to analyze insurance data to gain insights into:

* **Customer demographics and behavior:** Understand the characteristics of different customer segments and their insurance purchasing patterns.
* **Policy trends and patterns:** Identify common policy types, coverage levels, and pricing strategies.
* **Risk factors and claims analysis:** Analyze factors that contribute to insurance claims and identify potential areas for risk mitigation.
* **Predictive modeling:** Develop models to predict customer churn, claim frequency, and insurance premiums.
* **Business recommendations:** Provide actionable insights to improve customer segmentation, pricing strategies, risk management, and overall business performance.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to provide valuable insights that can help insurance companies optimize their operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive profitability.
 
**Specific questions to be addressed:**

* What are the key demographics of the insurance policyholders?
